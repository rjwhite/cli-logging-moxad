    original version 0.1.0

0.2.0   Aug 19, 2025:
    cli_logging/logging_utils.py:
        - removed all the complexity for setting up handlers for printing
          a subroutine utility name.  Too much complexity.
        - It now tries to prepend a program-name if it is available.
        - As for any sub-routine name you eant printed, if you want to
          have one, prepend your message you send. eg:
                logging.debug("function-name: my debug message")
        - Now anything above INFO and DEBUG go to stderr. - otherwise stdout.
        - Better comments.
        - Added _VERSION
    cli_logging/__init__.py:
        - imports _VERSION
    LICENSE, README.txt, README.md:
        - added
    pyproject.toml:
        - added:  readme = "README.md"
    testing/test.py:
        - added test program

0.3.0   Aug 19, 2025:
    Makefile:
        - improved.  added separate install-dev target.
    cli_logging/logging_utils.py:
        - added new optional 3rd argument to setup_cli_logging()
          use_color that defaults to True
        - __main__ checks for --nocolor option and passes that on
          to setup_cli_logging()
    testing/test.py
        - updated to use new --nocolor option
    README.md, README.txt:
        - updated

0.4.0   Aug 19, 2025:
    cli_logging/logging_utils.py:
        - rewrote setup_cli_logging() to use colorlog module to simplify
          things, give us the ability to color the entire message instead
          of just the message severity level, and get rid of he ugly
          encompassing colored block around some levels, like CRITICAL.
          Also, the colors are now given in English instead of ugly ANSI
          color codes.
          Does require installing colorlog module though.
          Added try/except block for imports to catch missing modules.
