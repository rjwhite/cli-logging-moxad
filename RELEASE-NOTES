    original version 0.1.0

0.2.0   Aug 19, 2025:
    cli_logging/logging_utils.py:
        - removed all the complexity for setting up handlers for printing
          a subroutine utility name.  Too much complexity.
        - It now tries to prepend a program-name if it is available.
        - As for any sub-routine name you eant printed, if you want to
          have one, prepend your message you send. eg:
                logging.debug("function-name: my debug message")
        - Now anything above INFO and DEBUG go to stderr. - otherwise stdout.
        - Better comments.
        - Added _VERSION
    cli_logging/__init__.py:
        - imports _VERSION
    LICENSE, README.txt, README.md:
